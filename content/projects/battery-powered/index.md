Written initially to provide visual feedback for a 2 part in-person voting event. I was able to incorporate the voting
process, which was originally done with wooden chips and paper money, into the application, eliminating a very
stressfull and error-prone process for the event coordinators. During lockdown I modified voting to be able to be done remotely which helped the organization maintain member engagement and continue to give millions of dollars to worthy organizations even without the ability to hold in person events.

Written in Meteor.js with React, and using MobX for front-end state management.
